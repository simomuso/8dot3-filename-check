# 8dot3-filename-check
A tool that allows you to check if a drive supports 8.3 file naming.

# How it works
1. Run "8dot3FileNameCheck.exe <driveLetter>:"

For instance, if the drive that you want to check is C:, the correct wat to use the tool is:
8dot3FilenameCheck.exe C:

If the drive supports 8.3 file naming, a success messagge will appear in the CMD window.

# What to know
- Capital/lower cases for drives are supported
- A log file containing the check command result will be created in the same executable folder.
